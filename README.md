# Purpose of Repository
This repository contains my work on an airline dataset provided by CloudJet. The goal is to analyze, explore, and visualize the data to generate meaningful insights. Through this project, I aim to gain hands-on experience with data visualization and contribute to produce high-quality data insights for the company. 

The dataset includes eight tables: `aircrafts_data`, `airports_data`, `boarding_passes`, `bookings`, `flights`, `seats`, `ticket_flights`, and `tickets`.
